    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <button class="accordion">Why MBTXTs?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Monkey Business texts are easier to procure than Non-Fungible Tokens.
        There is only one of each document ever replicated with knowledgeable
        proof that it is your property. They have the potential to be far more
        valuable than a simple image that has been copied and pasted everywhere.
        Your Monkey Business Text Document (MBTXTs for short) may assort itself
        into the cure for rare cancers, it may be the sappiest love poem for
        your favorite person in the world. All you have to do to possibly get
        that and claim it for yourself is make a purchase.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How secure are my MBTXTs?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Your property is as safe as you make it. The document is hidden behind
        your email, password, and an optional two-factor authentication feature.
        We are not liable for your password breaches but our staff is willing to
        work 24/7 to help you get your security back in your hands.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What if I don't like what I paid for?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Sorry to break it to you but if you read how the site works, you will
        know that what you get is just that. There is a 50% off refund policy in
        the first week of purchase but you have to understand that you could
        just keep retrying and abusing our service if there is a total refund
        policy. If you go through the refund process, please know that we will
        be re-submitting that text back into the possible purchase pool.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">
      My child is interested in this but I am worried about potential content
      exposure.
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        We have an age-safe mode where if you are under 18, we will
        automatically have a bot scour the text for foul language and other
        concerns and if it finds anything of the sort, it will not be the
        selected MBTXT for your child. Simply put, there is a content lock for
        people who have such concerns.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">
      How do people know that it is my MBTXT and not just writing?
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        The MBTXT file is not easily replicated and produces a checksum that is
        unique to every document. It is not a text document. It is a special
        application that is only used for Monkey Business Text Files and you
        have the special code that proves it is yours.
      </p>
