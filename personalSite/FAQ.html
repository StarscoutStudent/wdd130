    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p>Why MBTXTs?
        Monkey Business texts are easier to procure than Non-Fungible Tokens. There is only one of each document ever replicated with knowledgeable proof that it is your property. They have the potential to be far more valuable than a simple image that has been copied and pasted everywhere. Your Monkey Business Text Document (MBTXTs for short) may assort itself into the cure for rare cancers, it may be the sappiest love poem for your favorite person in the world. All you have to do to possibly get that and claim it for yourself is make a purchase.
        
        How secure are my MBTXTs?
        Your property is as safe as you make it. The document is hidden behind your email, password, and an optional two-factor authentication feature. We are not liable for your password breaches but our staff is willing to work 24/7 to help you get your security back in your hands. 
        
        What if I donâ€™t like what I paid for?
        Sorry to break it to you but if you read how the site works, you will know that what you get is just that. There is a 50% off refund policy in the first week of purchase but you have to understand that you could just keep retrying and abusing our service if there is a total refund policy. If you go through the refund process, please know that we will be re-submitting that text back into the possible purchase pool.
        
        My child is interested in this but I am worried about potential content exposure.
        We have an age-safe mode where if you are under 18, we will automatically have a bot scour the text for foul language and other concerns and if it finds anything of the sort, it will not be the selected MBTXT for your child. Simply put, there is a content lock for people who have such concerns.
        How do people know that it is my MBTXT and not just writing?
        The MBTXT file is not easily replicated and produces a checksum that is unique to every document. It is not a text document. It is a special application that is only used for Monkey Business Text Files and you have the special code that proves it is yours.
